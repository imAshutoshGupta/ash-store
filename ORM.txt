class Classname():            id|name|price|qty|cat|is_available
    id=
    name=
    price=                   EACH VALUE WILL MATCH EACH VALUE FROM ROWS
    qty=                     THIS IS CALLED MAPPING (IT MAPS DATA FROM TABLE TO MODELS)
    cat=
    is_avail=

row is called tuple
column is called as attribute


1. Model is a class defined in models.py (class is basically table-name)
2. classname = tablename
3. class data members = table columnname
4. object of model class = row in table

--> When a data is added in the table it creates an object 
--> the module imported (models) helps us to add datatype of the column

====================================================
write this in models file, then install pip install mysqlclient
change settings.py and run

then run python manage.py makemigrations 
and run python manage.py migrate

ORM queries
To insert record
syntax

User Dashboard
Its an html page or template where user gets all controls such as view data, insert, delete, edit data, filters, sorting etc.

EDIT DELETE IN ORM
in sql we do "delete from tablename | where condition"
in ORM we first match the id (condition) and then execute that command

1) Search that row
2) Delete it

search syntax
modelname.objects.filter(condition)

delete syntax
object.delete()
