class Classname():            id|name|price|qty|cat|is_available
    id=
    name=
    price=                   EACH VALUE WILL MATCH EACH VALUE FROM ROWS
    qty=                     THIS IS CALLED MAPPING (IT MAPS DATA FROM TABLE TO MODELS)
    cat=
    is_avail=

row is called tuple
column is called as attribute


1. Model is a class defined in models.py (class is basically table-name)
2. classname = tablename
3. class data members = table columnname
4. object of model class = row in table

--> When a data is added in the table it creates an object 
--> the module imported (models) helps us to add datatype of the column

====================================================
write this in models file, then install pip install mysqlclient
change settings.py and run

then run python manage.py makemigrations 
and run python manage.py migrate
