Sessions:
Sessions is a piece of information or data stored on server-side.
Data in sessions is stored in the form of key and value i.e in python, session is in the form of dictionary.

Advantage - Data stored in session can be accessed anywhere.
            Data stored in session is secured as it is stored in server-side, hence the sensitve information such as username, password are stored in sessions.

On the server-side, session data can be stored in two ways.
1) In file
2) In database table

In django session data is stored in django_session table.

-> login() function
